# Weight Prediction Web App

This is a web application built using Flask that allows users to predict weights based on input features. It utilizes a machine learning model to make predictions and provides both a web interface and a RESTful API.

## Features

- Predict weight based on four features:
  - Price per week
  - Population
  - Monthly income
  - Average parking per month

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- NumPy: A library for numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library in Python for model building.
- HTML/CSS: For the web interface.
- Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and model training.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You'll also need `pip` for managing Python packages.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
   cd your_repository_name
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask numpy scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

3. Place your model (`model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`) files in the root of the project folder.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Jupyter Notebook (`uber_regression.ipynb`) provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset used for training the model. It includes:

- **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and inspecting its structure.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for modeling.
- **Feature Analysis**: Exploring the relationships between features and the target variable, visualizing distributions, and correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling the data using `MinMaxScaler` for better model performance.

### How to Run the Notebook

1. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook:

   ```bash
   cd your_repository_name
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `uber_regression.ipynb` and follow the cells to perform EDA and model training.

## Running the Application

To start the Flask application, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Using the Web Interface

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
- Fill in the required features in the form and click "Predict" to see the result.

### Using the API

To make predictions via the API, you can send a POST request to the `/api/predict` endpoint with the required features in JSON format. Hereâ€™s an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"features": [30, 1705000, 9200, 80]}'
```

The response will contain the predicted weight in JSON format.
